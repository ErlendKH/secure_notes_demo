# Secure Notes Demo App

**Secure Notes Demo App** is a simple **Jetpack Compose** based Android app.  
It demonstrates modern Android development practices with a focus on **secure local storage** and **maintainable design**.



## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/secure-notes-demo.git
2. Open in Android Studio.

3. Sync Gradle and run the app on an emulator or device.



## Key Features

- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern, declarative UI toolkit for Android  
- **SQLCipher**: Encrypted local database for secure note storage  
- **Separation of concerns**: UI, ViewModel, and data handling kept in distinct layers  

### Why Jetpack Compose (instead of XML)?
- **Declarative UI**: Instead of describing *how* to build the UI step by step in XML, we describe *what the UI should look like* given the current state.
- **Less boilerplate**: No need for separate XML files and `findViewById()`.
- **Powerful state management**: UI automatically updates when state changes.
- **Modern Android standard**: Compose is Googleâ€™s recommended way forward.



## Architecture Overview

The app follows a simple layered structure:

- **UI layer**: Jetpack Compose screens (`NotesScreen`, `UpgradeScreen`, etc.)  
- **State layer**: ViewModels manage app state and business logic  
- **Data layer**: Database access with SQLCipher
